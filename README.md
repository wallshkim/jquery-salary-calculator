# Employee Salary Calculator

## Description

This application allows a business to keep track of current employee information and calculate the total monthly cost for employee salaries. It does this by collecting input employee information, storing the information in a table, and adding up employee salaries to report monthly costs. It also allows employees to be deleted from the table while simultaneously updating the total monthly cost.
